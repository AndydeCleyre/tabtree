<strong>Attention: do not use this add-on with Tab Groups (Panorama)</strong>

This extension implements the "tabs in a form of a tree structure" conception. It hides the default tabs (at the top) and reduces (optionally) the thick default borders around navigation bar. Instead the new tree tabs appear on the left (or right).

This extension was conceived as an alternative to Tree Style Tab to provide better performance, stability and usability.

If you have never tried "tabs in a form of a tree structure" and you don't know what it's needed for and you have many tabs opened (not just 3 or 4) then try it. It's a very convenient way to handle tabs when you have a lot of them and some people (including myself) can't imagine their main browser with the ordinary tabs at the top.

Keyboard Shortcuts (not configurable yet):
<ul>
  <li>F8 — Toggle one (or two) of four auto-hiding options corresponding to a current window state (Maximized/Normal/Fullscreen/One tab):
    <ul>
      <li>When an active window is in full screen F8 toggles the option for full screen windows</li>
      <li>When an active window is maximized F8 toggles the option for maximized windows</li>
      <li>When an active window is normal F8 toggles the option for normal windows</li>
      <li>When an active window has only one tab F8 toggles the option for all windows with one tab</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ctrl+Shift+PageUp/Down — Move Tab in focus (with its children) Up/Down</li>
  <li>Ctrl+Alt+Shift+PageUp/Down — Slowly Move Tab in focus (with its children) Up/Down, i.e. entering a subtree wherever it's possible</li>
  <li>Shift+Alt+PageUp/Down — Fast Move Tab in focus (with its children) Up/Down, i.e. not entering subtrees</li>
  <li>Ctrl+Shift+Left/Right — Decrease/Increase the indentation of Tab in focus by one level</li>
  <li>Ctrl+Alt+Shift+F — Focus Tab Search Bar</li>

  <li>Shift+DoubleClick on the tabbar — Open a new window</li>
  <li>Drag and drop a link from a web-page to the tree (optionally holding Shift) — Open a link in a new background/foreground tab (depends on Firefox option "General -> When I open a link in a new tab, switch to it immediately (browser.tabs.loadInBackground)", holding Shift inverts the behavior)</li>
</ul>

<strong>If you have <em>Intel graphics</em> and any strange problems with this add-on (e.g. Tab Tree isn't visible) please try disabling "Use hardware acceleration when available" in Firefox options (Options -> Advanced -> General). To quickly disable this add-on use Ctrl+Shift+A to bring up Add-on Manager.</strong>
