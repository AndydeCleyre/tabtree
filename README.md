## Description
It's a Firefox extension. Tabs Tree shows your tabs in the form of a tree structure. And also makes user interface compact (in height) to allow more space for the Web. It hides default tabs (at the top) and reduces the thick default borders around navigation bar. Instead the new tree tabs appear at the left:

- You can drag and drop an individual tab or a subtree of tabs
- You can drag and drop links from a web page to the tabs tree
- You can drag and drop a tab to and from the pinned tabs area
- You can set the focus to address or search bar by clicking the top edge of the screen (while Firefox is maximized)
- You can click the "Go back one page" button by clicking the top left corner of the screen (while Firefox is maximized)
- And also you can search thought the tabs using the "Tabs quick search" bar
